\section*{Author summary}

Despite ongoing advances in public health, medicine, and related fields,
influenza remains an ever-present burden to modern society. One way in which
the impact of influenza outbreaks can be reduced is though greater situational
awareness, leading to improvements in prevention and preparedness. The advent
of digital surveillance and advances in the field of epidemiological
forecasting have given rise to a diverse set of noisy proxies of influenza
activity. It has been shown that a combination of several such proxies results
in increased signal-to-noise ratio and overall more accurate nowcasts at the US
national level. However, serious challenges remain in assimilating proxies
which vary in geographic resolution and which may be intermittently available.
To address these issues, we propose a sensor fusion approach to nowcasting
influenza. In agreement with previous results, we find that aggregate nowcasts
are overall more accurate than individual proxies. Furthermore, we produce
nowcasts at the level of US states, even though most proxies are only available
nationally or regionally. We make available ongoing, weekly nowcasts of
influenza activity in the US---nationally, regionally, and for all states.

\section*{Introduction}

\subsection*{Background}

Annual influenza epidemics incur tremendous expenses and are strongly
detrimental to societal wellbeing \cite{szucs1999socio, Stohr2002,
molinari2007annual, who_flu_impact}. One way in which these impacts can be
lessened is though outbreak forewarning and therefore improved preparedness
\cite{myers2000}. This has been a primary impetus in the development of a large
number of influenza forecasting frameworks in recent years \cite{nsoesie2013a,
chretien2014, brooks2015, farrow2017human}. TODO(cite new brooks, cdc papers)

Forecasting critically depends on timely and accurate situational awareness,
and in the United States (US) one widespread measure of influenza burden is the
population-weighted percent influenza-like illness (wILI), derived from the US
Outpatient Influenza-Like Illness Surveillance Network (ILINet). On a weekly
basis, health care providers who have volunteered to participate in the ILINet
program submit, among other data, the percent of their cases that have met the
syndromic criteria of Influenza-Like Illness (\%ILI)---fever with either cough
or sore throat, without a known cause other than influenza \cite{wilidef,
who_ili_def}. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) publishes
weekly wILI---a weighted combination of state \%ILI---for several locations
within the US, including the ten Health and Human Services (HHS) regions, the
nine census divisions, and the majority of US states and territories.

Although \%ILI, and by extension wILI, is highly beneficial in a number of
settings \cite{ritzwoller2005comparison, thompson2006epidemiology,
m2008infectious}, it is ill-suited for real-time estimation of influenza
activity for several reasons. First, there is an inherent delay of one or more
weeks between patient care and wILI availability. In the typical and best case,
data collected between Sunday and Saturday of some week is reported on Friday
of the following week. Second, wILI is subject to retrospective and significant
revision due to a process we refer to as ``backfill''. Backfill is the eventual
incorporation of reports submitted multiple weeks after patient care, and with
the additional data comes a different, but more representative, value of wILI.
Third, wILI is aggregated across broad geographic regions before publication.
It is well known, however, that the spread of influenza---particularly around
the peak of the epidemic---is spatially heterogeneous between and within states
\cite{bonabeau1998geographical, viboud2006synchrony, eggo2010spatial,
viboud2013contrasting, gog2014spatial}, and therefore regional, divisional, and
especially national wILI is a convolution of influenza activity within
constituent states.

\subsection*{Related Work}

An approach often used to address some of these issues is to incorporate novel
data streams (NDS) \cite{althouse2015enhancing}. These signals, when based on
search queries \cite{eysenbach2006infodemiology, polgreen2008using,
hulth2009web, ginsberg2009, dugas2013, araz2014using, santillana2014can,
preis2014adaptive}, social media \cite{ritterman2009, culotta2010towards,
signorini2011use, achrekar2011predicting, broniatowski2013national,
paul2014twitter}, information-seeking behavior \cite{generous2014global,
mciver2014wikipedia, hickmann2015forecasting}, and participatory surveillance
\cite{smolinski2015flu, chunara2013flu}, are collectively termed ``digital
surveillance'', as opposed to traditional surveillance of which wILI is one
example. Although many of these signals are available with little to no lag,
each has distinct shortcomings, and it seems that common practice has been to
nowcast wILI using any one of the available digital surveillance signals in
isolation. However, it was more recently demonstrated that multiple digital
surveillance signals can be used in parallel to produce more accurate nowcasts
of national wILI \cite{santillana2015combining}.

\subsection*{Contribution}

We propose nowcasting influenza through \emph{sensor
fusion}~\cite{farrow2016modeling} of digital surveillance. Derived from the
Kalman filter \cite{kalman1960new}, sensor fusion is optimal in a least-squares
sense (up to assumptions of independence and normality), robust to noise,
tolerant of missing data, and capable of assimilating data across varying
geospatial resolutions. We implement a sensor fusion framework and apply it to
nowcasting ILI in US states and territories (and in any combination thereof,
including HHS regions, census divisions, and the US as a whole), based on the
assimilation of any and all surveillance data available at runtime.

\section*{Materials and methods}

\subsection*{Data Sources}

Data sources used in nowcasting can be broadly separated into two classes:
ground truth and surveillance. The aim at any given point in time is to predict
ground truth, given surveillance. Surveillance can be further divided into
digital surveillance (e.g. based on social media) and predictive surveillance
(e.g. based on short-term forecasts). Below are the specific data sources we
use in each category.

\subsubsection*{Ground Truth}

\begin{description}
  \item{\textbf{Population weighted percent Influenza-like Illness (wILI)}} \\
    Each week, CDC publishes wILI for the US as a whole, the 10 HHS regions,
    the 9 census divisions, and most states and territories \cite{wilisrc}. In
    any given location, wILI is the mean (weighted by population) of ILI in
    constituent locations. ILI is the percent of influenza-like illness out of
    all patient visits voluntarily reported by participating healthcare
    providers. Because reports continue to be integrated after initial
    publication, wILI is subject to retrospective revision in a process we
    refer to as ``backfill''. As a result, wILI is effectively versioned. When
    training models and making predictions, we use preliminary---not
    final---values of wILI whenever possible.
\end{description}

\subsubsection*{Digital Surveillance}

\begin{description}
  \item{\textbf{Google Flu Trends (GFT)}} \\
    Google Flu Trends was a weekly prediction of wILI based on Google searches.
    The service was originally released in 2008; was updated in 2009, 2013, and
    2014 \cite{ginsberg2009, gft_main}; and was discontinued in 2015.
  \item{\textbf{Google Health Trends (GHT)}} \\
    Google Health Trends is an API by Google for research purposes which makes
    available, among many other things, daily counts (on an arbitrary scale)
    for a predefined influenza topic. TODO(link)
  \item{\textbf{HealthTweets (TWTR)}} \\
    HealthTweets (http://healthtweets.org) makes available the daily volume of
    tweets indicative of ILI \cite{broniatowski2013national,
    dredze2014healthtweets}.
  \item{\textbf{Wikimedia Foundation (WIKI)}} \\
    The Wikimedia Foundation makes available the number of hits, per hour, to
    every Wikipedia article. TODO(link)
  \item{\textbf{CDC Page Hits (CDCP)}} \\
    CDC makes available the number of daily hits per page, per state for their
    website (https:/www.cdc.gov/).
\end{description}

\subsubsection*{Predictive Surveillance}

\begin{description}
  \item{\textbf{Epicast (EPIC)}} \\
    Epicast \cite{farrow2017human} is an influenza forecasting system based on
    collective human judgment. From these forecasts, we interpret the
    one-week-ahead value of wILI as a nowcast. TODO(link)
  \item{\textbf{Seasonal Autoregression (SAR3)}} \\
    SAR3 \cite{farrow2016modeling} provides an autoregression estimate of wILI
    on the current week. TODO(link)
  \item{\textbf{Epidemic Archetype (ARCH)}} \\
    ARCH \cite{farrow2016modeling} is an empirical model based on the Empirical
    Bayes forecasting framework \cite{brooks2015}. Like Epicast, ARCH provides
    a short-term epidemiological forecast from which we interpret the
    one-week-ahead prediction as a nowcast.
\end{description}

With the exception of Google Health Trends, these data sources are publicly
available via the Delphi Epidata API. TODO(can we share TWTR? GHT?) TODO(link)

\subsection*{Fitting}

To obtain a signal usable for nowcasting, we must fit inputs to wILI. Since
this is trivially the case for predictive surveillance (i.e. EPIC, SAR3, and
ARCH), we use those values directly. For digital survaillance, we use
historical data to build a linear regression model mapping raw inputs to wILI.
We then apply this model with the most recent data to obtain a prediction of
wILI. We repeat the fitting procedure each week prior to nowcasting to obtain a
new model based on the most up-to-date data. The fitting procedure is described
in more detail in \cite{farrow2016modeling}.

Data sources with a single covariate (i.e. GFT, GHT, TWTR) are fit with
ordinary linear regression. Data sources with multiple covariates (i.e. WIKI,
CDCP) are fit with multiple linear regression.

As others have done for flu and other infectious diseases
\cite{generous2014global, hickmann2015forecasting, mciver2014wikipedia}, we use
the volume of Wikipedia traffic to estimate wILI for the US as a whole. To
produce a signal, we fit seven covariates to wILI, each corresponding to a
particular flu-releated Wikipedia article. The articles TODO(list in SI) were
chosen offline and by hand \textit{a priori}. Since WIKI has no attached
location information, we filter by particular hours of the day TODO(list in SI)
as a very rough proxy of Wikipedia activity in the US. Although this is a
grossly invalid assumption, preliminary investigation showed this to provide a
better fit to wILI.

Similarly, CDCP consists of six covariates, each corresponding to a particular
flu-releated page on the CDC website. The pages TODO(list in SI) were chosen
offline and by hand \textit{a priori}. CDCP is unique in that the covariates
are log-transformed before fitting as preliminary investigation showed this to
provide a better fit to wILI.

For all digital surveillance sources, we apply the fitting procedure separately
for each available location (e.g. US as a whole, HHS regions, census divisions,
and US states).

For data sources with sub-weekly temporal resolution (i.e. GHT, TWTR, WIKI,
CDCP), we aggregate counts by week before applying the fitting procedure. In
future work we aim to incorporate these sources as soon as they are available,
rather than waiting until the end of the week to use their aggregate values.
