% -- FIGURES AND TABLES
%
% Please include tables/figure captions directly after the paragraph where they are first cited in the text.
%
% DO NOT INCLUDE GRAPHICS IN YOUR MANUSCRIPT
% - Figures should be uploaded separately from your manuscript file.
% - Figures generated using LaTeX should be extracted and removed from the PDF before submission.
% - Figures containing multiple panels/subfigures must be combined into one image file before submission.
% For figure citations, please use "Fig" instead of "Figure".
% See http://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/figures for PLOS figure guidelines.
%
% Tables should be cell-based and may not contain:
% - spacing/line breaks within cells to alter layout or alignment
% - do not nest tabular environments (no tabular environments within tabular environments)
% - no graphics or colored text (cell background color/shading OK)
% See http://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/tables for table guidelines.
%
% For tables that exceed the width of the text column, use the adjustwidth environment as illustrated in the example table in text below.

% IMPORTANT
% Below are a few tips to help format your equations and other special characters according to our specifications. For more tips to help reduce the possibility of formatting errors during conversion, please see our LaTeX guidelines at http://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/latex
%
% For inline equations, please be sure to include all portions of an equation in the math environment.  For example, x$^2$ is incorrect; this should be formatted as $x^2$ (or $\mathrm{x}^2$ if the romanized font is desired).
%
% Do not include text that is not math in the math environment. For example, CO2 should be written as CO\textsubscript{2} instead of CO$_2$.
%
% Please add line breaks to long display equations when possible in order to fit size of the column.
%
% For inline equations, please do not include punctuation (commas, etc) within the math environment unless this is part of the equation.
%
% When adding superscript or subscripts outside of brackets/braces, please group using {}.  For example, change "[U(D,E,\gamma)]^2" to "{[U(D,E,\gamma)]}^2".
%
% Do not use \cal for caligraphic font.  Instead, use \mathcal{}

\section*{Author summary}

Despite ongoing advances in public health, medicine, and related fields,
influenza remains an ever-present burden to modern society. One way in which
the impact of influenza outbreaks can be reduced is though greater situational
awareness, leading to improvements in prevention and preparedness. The advent
of digital surveillance and advances in the field of epidemiological
forecasting have given rise to a diverse set of noisy proxies of influenza
activity. It has been shown that a combination of several such proxies results
in increased signal-to-noise ratio and overall more accurate nowcasts at the US
national level. However, serious challenges remain in assimilating proxies
which vary in geographic resolution and which may be intermittently available.
To address these issues, we propose a sensor fusion approach to nowcasting
influenza. In agreement with previous results, we find that aggregate nowcasts
are overall more accurate than individual proxies. Furthermore, we produce
nowcasts at the level of US states, even though most proxies are only available
nationally or regionally. We make available ongoing, weekly nowcasts of
influenza activity in the US---nationally, regionally, and for all states.

\section*{Introduction}

\subsection*{Background}

Annual influenza epidemics incur tremendous expenses and are strongly
detrimental to societal wellbeing \cite{szucs1999socio, Stohr2002,
molinari2007annual, who_flu_impact}. One way in which these impacts can be
lessened is though outbreak forewarning and therefore improved preparedness
\cite{myers2000}. This has been a primary impetus in the development of a large
number of influenza forecasting frameworks in recent years \cite{nsoesie2013a,
chretien2014, brooks2015, farrow2017human}. TODO(cite new brooks, cdc papers)

Forecasting critically depends on timely and accurate situational awareness,
and in the United States (US) one widespread measure of influenza burden is the
population-weighted percent influenza-like illness (wILI), derived from the US
Outpatient Influenza-Like Illness Surveillance Network (ILINet). On a weekly
basis, health care providers who have volunteered to participate in the ILINet
program submit, among other data, the percent of their cases that have met the
syndromic criteria of Influenza-Like Illness (\%ILI)---fever with either cough
or sore throat, without a known cause other than influenza \cite{wilidef,
who_ili_def}. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) publishes
weekly wILI---a weighted combination of state \%ILI---for several locations
within the US, including the ten Health and Human Services (HHS) regions, the
nine census divisions, and the majority of US states and territories.

Although \%ILI, and by extension wILI, is highly beneficial in a number of
settings \cite{ritzwoller2005comparison, thompson2006epidemiology,
m2008infectious}, it is ill-suited for real-time estimation of influenza
activity for several reasons. First, there is an inherent delay of one or more
weeks between patient care and wILI availability. In the typical and best case,
data collected between Sunday and Saturday of some week is reported on Friday
of the following week. Second, wILI is subject to retrospective and significant
revision due to a process we refer to as ``backfill''. Backfill is the eventual
incorporation of reports submitted multiple weeks after patient care, and with
the additional data comes a different, but more representative, value of wILI.
Third, wILI is aggregated across broad geographic regions before publication.
It is well known, however, that the spread of influenza---particularly around
the peak of the epidemic---is spatially heterogeneous between and within states
\cite{bonabeau1998geographical, viboud2006synchrony, eggo2010spatial,
viboud2013contrasting, gog2014spatial}, and therefore regional, divisional, and
especially national wILI is a convolution of influenza activity within
constituent states.
